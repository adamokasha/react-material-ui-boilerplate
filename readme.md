## React and Material UI boilerplate with Webpack 4.

##### [Live Deployment on heroku](https://rbp-mui.herokuapp.com/)

### Features
* Material UI
  * Premade component set for rapid prototyping.
* Private and public routing setup.
* Webpack 4 
* Jest and Enzyme for testing.

### Usage in Development
1. Clone repo and install dependencies.
2. Run 'npm run dev' from cli to generate public/dist.
3. Run 'npm run dev-server' for development with live-reloading.
